# HCI

A designer wants to evaluate two interfaces A and B. He designed an experiment, and asked the partic- ipants to perform different tasks using each interface and recorded the completion time and the number of errors committed during the task completion. The collected data are stored in .csv files. The format is as follows:

• The data consists of four .csv files, two for interface A, and two for interface B.
• The file task time.csv contains the task completion time.
– Each row represents a user, it contains the times to complete the tasks. – Each column represent a task.
• The file task error.csv contains the number of errors committed by the participant when trying to complete a task.
– Each row represents a user, it contains the number of errors committed during the process of completing the task.
– Each column represent a task.

1. Write the python code to read the data and decide which interface is better. Your code should:
2. 
• Display which system is better with respect to task 1, and the statistical measure used. 
• Display which system is better with respect to task 2, and the statistical measure used. 
• Display which system is better with respect to task 3, and the statistical measure used. 
• Display which system is better with respect to task k, and the statistical measure used. 
• Display which system is better, and the statistical measure used.
